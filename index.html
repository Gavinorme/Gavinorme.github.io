                <p>UofSC students are frustrated with not being able to know what food is being served before they swipe their meal cards such as in Russell House and other dining areas. Especially with their hectic class schedules, finding delicious and nutritious meals on a time crunch can be a big challenge. Unfortunately, this predicament often causes people to waste a meal swipe on food they dislike and waste precious minutes on time that could be used elsewhere. Thus, our solution should provide a way for users to see what is being served at each dining hall everyday. </p>
